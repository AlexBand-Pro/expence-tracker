Suggestions & Next Steps
Code Organization & Maintainability

Split your JS into modules (e.g. storage.js, ui.js, chart.js, theme.js) so each file is smaller and easier to navigate.

Robustness & Testing

Guard your localStorage reads with try/catch so a malformed entry can’t break the entire app.

Consider writing a few unit tests for your pure functions (getTotalSpent, getCategoryBreakdown, date‑filter logic) with Jest or a browser‑test framework.
