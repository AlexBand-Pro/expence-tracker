Suggestions & Next Steps
Code Organization & Maintainability

Split your JS into modules (e.g. storage.js, ui.js, chart.js, theme.js) so each file is smaller and easier to navigate.

Robustness & Testing

Guard your localStorage reads with try/catch so a malformed entry can’t break the entire app.

Consider writing a few unit tests for your pure functions (getTotalSpent, getCategoryBreakdown, date‑filter logic) with Jest or a browser‑test framework.

Accessibility Enhancements

Add aria-live="polite" (or assertive) regions around your success, error, and over‑cap modals so screen readers announce them.

Performance & Scaling

If a user logs hundreds of entries, rendering all of them can get slow. You could implement virtual scrolling or pagination to keep the list snappy.

Debounce your filter inputs so rapid typing/selection doesn’t trigger too many renders.

Polish & Extras

Turn it into a Progressive Web App with a service worker and offline caching—so you can demo it even when you’re offline.

Add export/import JSON in addition to CSV for power users to back up/restore entire data sets.

Include a README with screenshots, a live demo link (via GitHub Pages or Netlify), and clear instructions so anyone landing on your repo can dive right in.

1. Form controls need proper labels
Right now you rely on placeholder text alone. Screen‑reader users (and anyone who types before seeing the placeholder) will miss what each field is for.

Fix: Add <label for="…"> for every <input> and <select>.

html
Copy
Edit
<label for="item">Item</label>
<input id="item" … />
You can visually hide the labels (e.g. with a “sr-only” class) if you don’t want them in the layout.

2. Convert expense list into a true list
You have

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="all-expenses" id="all-expenses">
  <p>Expenses:</p>
</div>
but individual expenses are probably injected as <div>s or <p>s.

Fix: Use <ul id="all-expenses"> and render each expense as <li>…</li> so screen‑readers know it’s a list.

3. Make the “Monthly Cap” panel a proper dialog
Right now it’s just a hidden <div> you show/hide. For keyboard & screen‑reader users you need:

role="dialog" (or <dialog>)

aria-modal="true" to block background content

aria-labelledby="…” pointing at the dialog’s title (e.g. a <h2>)

Focus‑trap logic (you’ve added that—great!)

Mark the rest of the page with aria-hidden="true" while the dialog is open

Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<div
  id="cap-setter"
  class="cap-setter hidden"
  role="dialog"
  aria-modal="true"
  aria-labelledby="cap-title"
>
  <h2 id="cap-title">Set monthly cap</h2>
  …
</div>
4. Chart canvas needs an accessible name/description
A bare <canvas id="category-chart"></canvas> is invisible to assistive tech. Either:

Add aria-label="Expenses by category" (or similar), or

Include descriptive fallback content inside the canvas tag.

5. Toggle buttons need state exposed
Your Dark‑Mode button reads “Light” and has an aria‑label of “click to toggle theme.” Better:

Use aria-pressed="false" (toggled to true in dark mode) so screen‑readers know it’s a toggle

Update its visible text or label dynamically (“Dark Mode” ↔ “Light Mode”)

html
Copy
Edit
<button
  id="dark-mode-btn"
  class="dark-mode-btn"
  aria-pressed="false"
>
  Light Mode
</button>
6. Ensure color contrast
Make sure your greens, ambers, grays, etc., all meet at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against their text. You can check them with any contrast checker (e.g. WebAIM).

✅ In summary
Label every form control

Use semantic lists for expenses

Turn your cap panel into a true modal/dialog with appropriate ARIA

Give your canvas an accessible name

Expose toggle state on dark‑mode button

Verify contrast ratios

With those tweaks, you’ll be in really solid shape for keyboard & screen‑reader users! Let me know if you’d like code snippets or examples for any specific piece.
